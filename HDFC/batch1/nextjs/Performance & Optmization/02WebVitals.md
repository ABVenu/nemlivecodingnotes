**Web Vitals** (or **Core Web Vitals**) are a set of **Google performance metrics** that measure how good a web page’s **user experience** is.

They focus on **loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability** — basically how fast and smooth your site feels to a real user.

## 📊 The 3 Core Web Vitals:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** → *Loading performance*

   * Measures how quickly the **main content** (like hero image, headline, or video) appears.
   * Good: ≤ **2.5s**
   * Poor: > **4s**

2. **First Input Delay (FID)** → *Interactivity*

   * Measures how quickly the page responds when the user first clicks, taps, or presses a key.
   * Good: ≤ **100ms**
   * Poor: > **300ms**
   * (⚡ Recently replaced by **INP – Interaction to Next Paint** as a more complete measure.)

3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** → *Visual stability*

   * Measures how much the page layout **jumps around** while loading.
   * Good: ≤ **0.1**
   * Poor: > **0.25**

## 🛠️ Why they matter?

* Google uses **Core Web Vitals as a ranking factor** in SEO.
* They reflect **real-world user experience** → not just synthetic speed tests.
* If your site scores badly → visitors may leave (higher bounce rate).

## 🧠 **What is Load Balancing in ECS?**

When you deploy multiple **ECS tasks (containers)** running the same service (for example, your Node.js backend), AWS uses a **Load Balancer** to:

* Distribute incoming traffic **evenly** across all running containers.
* **Automatically detect** healthy vs unhealthy containers.
* **Scale** as new containers start or stop.

Essentially, this makes your app **fault-tolerant and scalable** — just like with EC2, but now managed for containers.

---

## ⚙️ **How ECS Load Balancing Works**

### Basic Flow:

1. **You deploy a service** (e.g., `backend-service`) in ECS.
2. The service launches **multiple tasks (containers)** — maybe 2, 3, or more.
3. You attach the service to a **Target Group** in a **Load Balancer (ALB or NLB)**.
4. When users hit the **Load Balancer DNS** (e.g., `myapp-alb-1234.elb.amazonaws.com`),
   AWS automatically routes each request to one of the healthy ECS tasks.

📘 In short:

> Load Balancer → Target Group → ECS Tasks (containers)

## 🧩 **Types of Load Balancers for ECS**

| Load Balancer                       | When to Use                           | Layer   | Typical Protocol |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | HTTP/HTTPS apps (REST APIs, websites) | Layer 7 | HTTP/HTTPS       |
| **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**     | Low-latency TCP/UDP traffic           | Layer 4 | TCP, UDP         |
| **Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)**     | Network appliances                    | Layer 3 | IP               |

✅ Most ECS services (especially Node.js/Express apps) use an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.

## ⚙️ **How ECS + ALB Integration Happens Internally**

1. **You define a Target Group** in the ALB.
   ECS tasks (containers) are automatically **registered** and **deregistered** from this group when they start/stop.

2. **ECS service definition** includes:

   * The **container port** (e.g., 3000)
   * The **target group ARN**
   * The **load balancer name**

3. When the ECS service launches new containers:

   * ALB automatically detects new IP:port pairs.
   * Health checks determine which containers are healthy.
   * Traffic is only sent to healthy ones.

## 🏗️ **Setup Steps (ECS with ALB)**

Let’s break this down practically 👇

### Step 1: Create an Application Load Balancer

* Go to **EC2 → Load Balancers → Create Load Balancer → Application Load Balancer**
* Scheme: `Internet-facing`
* Choose subnets across **2 Availability Zones**.
* Create a **Security Group** that allows inbound traffic on port 80 (or 443 if HTTPS).

---

### Step 2: Create a Target Group

* Go to **EC2 → Target Groups → Create Target Group**
* Choose:

  * Target Type: `IP` (important for ECS Fargate)
  * Protocol: HTTP
  * Port: 80
* Set health check path: `/` or `/health`
* This Target Group will later attach to your ECS service.

---

### Step 3: Create an ECS Cluster

* Go to **ECS → Clusters → Create Cluster**
* Choose **Networking only (Fargate)** or **EC2 + ECS** depending on your setup.

---

### Step 4: Create a Task Definition

* Define your container details:

  * Container image (ECR image)
  * Port mappings (e.g., container port 3000)
  * CPU and memory limits

---

### Step 5: Create a Service (Attach Load Balancer)

* Go to **ECS → Services → Create**
* Launch type: `Fargate` (serverless) or `EC2`
* Select:

  * Cluster
  * Task Definition
  * Number of tasks (say, 2)
* Under **Load Balancing:**

  * Choose **Application Load Balancer**
  * Select your Target Group
  * Map container port (e.g., 3000)

ECS automatically registers all running containers to the Target Group.

---

### Step 6: Test the Setup

* Once the service is running, get the **ALB DNS name** (e.g., `my-ecs-alb-123.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com`)
* Visit that URL → You should see your app response (load-balanced between containers).

---

## 🧩 **What Happens Behind the Scenes**

1. ALB receives request at port 80.
2. ALB checks the Target Group for **healthy containers**.
3. ALB forwards the request to one container’s IP + port.
4. ECS monitors container health; if a container fails, it’s **replaced** and ALB updates automatically.

## 💡 **ECS Load Balancing Benefits**

| Benefit                      | Description                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto Registration**        | Containers automatically added/removed from target group |
| **Health Checks**            | Automatically disables unhealthy containers              |
| **Scalability**              | Works with Auto Scaling to add/remove containers         |
| **Zero Downtime Deployment** | New versions roll out without downtime                   |
| **HTTPS Ready**              | You can add SSL certificates in ALB                      |

## 📊 **Example Architecture**

```
              Internet
                 │
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │ Application LB  │
        └─────┬───────────┘
              │
      ┌───────┴────────┐
      │                │
┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐
│ ECS Task #1 │   │ ECS Task #2 │
│  (Port 3000)│   │  (Port 3000)│
└─────────────┘   └─────────────┘
      │                │
      └────→ Target Group ←──────┘
```

## 🧩 **Real Example**

If your backend (Node.js/Express) is running on ECS Fargate, and you scale it to 3 tasks:

* ALB routes incoming requests evenly:

  ```
  Req 1 → Container 1
  Req 2 → Container 2
  Req 3 → Container 3
  Req 4 → Container 1
  ...
  ```

If one task becomes unhealthy → ALB removes it automatically.

| 2️⃣ Create Target Group | Route to ECS containers         |
| 3️⃣ Create ECS Service  | Attach to ALB                   |

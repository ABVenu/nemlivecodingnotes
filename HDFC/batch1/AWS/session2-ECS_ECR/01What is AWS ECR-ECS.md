üìò **Building and Deploying Containers with ECR & ECS**

---

## üß© 1. Recap ‚Äî What are Containers & Docker?

### üîπ What is a Container?

A **container** is a lightweight, portable unit that packages:

* Your **application code**
* **Dependencies** (libraries, runtimes)
* **Environment configuration**

All bundled together so it **runs the same way everywhere** ‚Äî on your local system, in testing, or in the cloud.

Think of it as a **mini isolated OS environment** that ensures:

> ‚ÄúIf it works on my machine, it works anywhere.‚Äù

---

### üîπ Why Containers?

| Problem                     | How Containers Help                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ÄúWorks on my machine‚Äù issue | Containers ship the environment with the code              |
| Environment mismatch        | Uniform runtime across systems                             |
| Heavy VMs                   | Containers share the same OS kernel, hence lightweight     |
| Scalability                 | Containers can be easily replicated & deployed in clusters |

---

### üîπ What is Docker?

Docker is the **containerization platform** that lets you:

* Build images (`Dockerfile`)
* Run containers (`docker run`)
* Manage lifecycle (`docker ps`, `docker stop`)
* Push images to registries (`docker push`)

So Docker = **Tool**, Container = **Runtime Unit**

## üß± 2. Docker Image vs Container

| Concept              | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docker Image**     | A blueprint (like a class in OOP). Immutable file that contains app + dependencies. |
| **Container**        | A running instance of an image. (like an object created from the class)             |
| **Dockerfile**       | A text file with instructions to build the image.                                   |
| **Docker Hub / ECR** | Registries where images are stored and shared.                                      |

---

## üê≥ 3. Amazon ECR ‚Äî Elastic Container Registry

### üîπ What is ECR?

Amazon **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** is a **fully managed Docker image registry** service by AWS.

It‚Äôs where you:

* Store your **Docker images** securely.
* Version and tag them.
* Retrieve them for **deployment in ECS or EKS**.

---

### üîπ Why ECR?

* **Private or Public repositories** (like GitHub for images)
* **Integrated with AWS IAM** for secure access
* **High availability & scalability**
* Works seamlessly with **ECS, EKS, and CodePipeline**

### üîπ Key Terminologies in ECR

| Term                    | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository**          | Logical grouping of Docker images. Example: `aws-node-demo`                                                                             |
| **Image**               | Actual Docker image pushed into the repo.                                                                                               |
| **Image Tag**           | Version identifier like `v1`, `latest`, etc.                                                                                            |
| **URI**                 | The full path to the image (used when pulling/deploying). Example: `123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/aws-node-demo:latest` |
| **Authorization Token** | Needed to authenticate Docker CLI with ECR. (`aws ecr get-login-password`)                                                              |

---

### üîπ ECR Workflow Summary

1. Create repository ‚Üí `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name aws-node-demo`
2. Authenticate Docker to ECR
   `aws ecr get-login-password | docker login ...`
3. Tag Docker image with ECR URI
   `docker tag myapp:latest <ECR_URI>:latest`
4. Push image ‚Üí `docker push <ECR_URI>:latest`

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 4. Amazon ECS ‚Äî Elastic Container Service

### üîπ What is ECS?

Amazon **ECS (Elastic Container Service)** is a **container orchestration service**.
It runs, manages, scales, and monitors **containers** (usually from ECR) automatically.

> Think of ECS as a ‚Äúcontainer manager‚Äù that handles how, where, and when containers run.

---

### üîπ ECS vs Docker

| Concept        | Docker                  | ECS                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Scope          | Local container runtime | Cloud container orchestration            |
| Responsibility | Build and run container | Deploy, scale, monitor containers        |
| Scale          | Manual                  | Automatic scaling, load balancing        |
| Integration    | Local only              | Works with EC2, Fargate, CloudWatch, IAM |

---

### üîπ ECS Launch Types

| Launch Type             | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2 Launch Type**     | Containers run on a cluster of EC2 instances managed by you.                                            |
| **FARGATE Launch Type** | Serverless ‚Äî AWS runs and manages the underlying infrastructure for you. You only specify CPU & memory. |

> Most modern deployments use **Fargate** because you don‚Äôt need to manage servers.

| **Service**              | Ensures a specific number of tasks are running; handles scaling & restarting          | Like a ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù keeping containers alive |
| **Container Definition** | Inside task definition; specifies image, ports, etc.                                  | Defines one specific container               |
| **Load Balancer**        | Optional component to distribute traffic across multiple containers                   | Like a traffic manager                       |
| **ECS Agent**            | A background process that runs on EC2 instances to communicate with ECS service       | Messenger between ECS and containers         |

---

### üîπ ECS Workflow Overview

1. **Create ECR repository** (store your Docker image)
2. **Build & Push Docker image** to ECR
3. **Create ECS Cluster** (logical group)
4. **Define Task Definition** (use ECR image)
5. **Create Service** (to run and manage tasks)
6. **Run ECS Task** (Fargate or EC2 launch type)
7. **Expose API** (optionally using Load Balancer or Public IP)

## üåç 8. Exposing API via Load Balancer

When you deploy multiple containers (for scaling), you can use:

* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for HTTP/HTTPS traffic
* ECS integrates automatically with ALB
* Load Balancer routes requests to available container instances

**Benefits:**

* Auto-scaling
* Zero-downtime deployments
* Health checks on containers

## üîí 9. Security & Access Control

| Security Feature    | Description                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IAM Roles**       | Control who can push/pull images from ECR, or deploy ECS services    |
| **ECS Task Role**   | Gives containers access to AWS services (like S3, DynamoDB) securely |
| **Private Subnets** | Deploy containers in VPCs for internal communication                 |
| **Security Groups** | Firewall rules for container networking                              |

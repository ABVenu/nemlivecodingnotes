## ðŸ§© COMMON REASON 1: Security Group (Firewall) Blocks Port 3000

By default, ECS tasks on Fargate **donâ€™t allow inbound traffic** unless you explicitly open it.

### âœ… Fix:

1. Go to **ECS â†’ Cluster â†’ Tasks â†’ Running Task â†’ Networking Tab**
   â†’ Click on the **ENI (Elastic Network Interface)** link â€” it will open the **EC2 Console**.

2. Scroll to **Security Groups** â†’ click the SG linked.

3. Go to **Inbound Rules â†’ Edit inbound rules â†’ Add Rule:**

   ```
   Type: Custom TCP
   Port: 3000
   Source: 0.0.0.0/0
   ```

   â†’ Save changes.

4. Refresh your browser with:

   ```
   http://<public-ip>:3000
   ```

âœ… Should load now.

## ðŸ§© COMMON REASON 2: Public IP Not Assigned

If the ECS task didnâ€™t get a public IP, you canâ€™t access it from the internet.

### âœ… Fix:

1. Go to your **ECS Service â†’ Tasks â†’ Click the running task**
2. Under **Network**, check **Public IP** field.

If it shows **none**:

* Edit your ECS Service or create a new one.
* In the **Networking section**, ensure:

  ```
  Subnets: Choose PUBLIC subnets
  Auto-assign public IP: ENABLED âœ…
  ```

Re-deploy service â†’ wait for new task â†’ copy its public IP.

## ðŸ§© COMMON REASON 3: App Binding to 127.0.0.1 (localhost)

Inside containers, apps must listen on **0.0.0.0**, not **localhost**, to be reachable externally.

### âœ… Fix:

In your `server.js`, make sure you have:

```js
app.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0", () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

Then rebuild and push again:

```bash
docker build -t node-aws-demo .
docker tag node-aws-demo:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/node-aws-demo:latest
docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/node-aws-demo:latest
```

Update ECS task definition â†’ deploy new revision.

## ðŸ§© COMMON REASON 4: Wrong Port Mapping in Task Definition

ECS task must expose the same port your container is listening on.

### âœ… Fix:

Go to **Task Definition â†’ Container Definition**
Check:

* **Port mappings:** `Container Port: 3000`
* **Protocol:** TCP

If your app uses a different port (e.g. 8080), update it in both Dockerfile and ECS task definition.

---

## ðŸ§© COMMON REASON 5: Dockerfile Expose Missing (less common but good practice)

Ensure your Dockerfile has:

```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 3000
```

Though optional for ECS, itâ€™s best practice.

---

## ðŸ§© (Optional) QUICK DEBUG TEST

Run this inside container locally (if possible):

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 node-aws-demo
curl http://localhost:3000
```

If it works locally â†’ your app + Docker setup are fine â†’ issue is AWS networking.

## âœ… TL;DR FIX CHECKLIST

| Check                 | Expected                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Security Group        | Inbound rule for TCP port 3000 from 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Subnet                | Public subnet                                 |
| Auto-assign Public IP | Enabled                                       |
| App listens on        | 0.0.0.0 not localhost                         |
| Task Definition port  | 3000                                          |
| Dockerfile            | `EXPOSE 3000`                                 |

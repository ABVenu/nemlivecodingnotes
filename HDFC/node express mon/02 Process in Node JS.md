---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Node.js Process?

* When you run:

  ```bash
  node app.js
  ```

  * The OS creates a **process** (like any other program).
  * That process has:

    * **PID (Process ID)**.
    * **Memory allocation (Heap, Stack, Code, Data segments)**.
    * **Single main thread** that executes your JavaScript.
    * **Background worker threads (thread pool)** created by **libuv**.

üëâ So Node.js is not ‚Äúmagical single thread only‚Äù ‚Üí It‚Äôs a **multi-threaded system under the hood**, but your **JavaScript runs in one main thread**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How Node.js Interacts with the OS

* Node.js runs on top of **libuv**, which provides the abstraction for OS system calls.
* Example:

  ```js
  fs.readFile("file.txt", cb);
  ```

  Flow:

  1. JS function ‚Üí Node‚Äôs `fs` module.
  2. `fs` calls **libuv**, which issues an OS system call (e.g., Linux `read`).
  3. OS handles the file I/O asynchronously.
  4. libuv puts callback in the **event loop queue** when done.
  5. Event loop ‚Üí executes your callback in JS.

So Node.js doesn‚Äôt do I/O itself ‚Üí It **delegates** to the OS & libuv.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ RAM Usage of Node.js

* **By default, Node.js process memory allocation (V8 heap limit):**

  * \~ **1.5 GB on 64-bit systems**.
  * \~ **512 MB on 32-bit systems**.
  * Configurable with:

    ```bash
    node --max-old-space-size=4096 app.js   # 4GB RAM
    ```
* Actual **RAM consumption** =

  * V8 heap + Stack + C++ bindings + libuv + loaded modules.
* A simple "Hello World" server \~ **30‚Äì50 MB RAM**.
* Large apps (Express + DB connections) \~ **100‚Äì500 MB per process**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ How Many Tasks Node.js Can Handle Simultaneously?

### ‚ö° Key Distinction: **Concurrency vs Parallelism**

* **Concurrency** = handling many tasks at the *same time* (interleaved).
* **Parallelism** = executing tasks *literally at the same instant* across multiple CPU cores.

---

### üîπ Node.js Model

* **Single-threaded event loop** handles **concurrent requests**.
* Parallelism comes from:

  * **libuv‚Äôs thread pool** (default = 4 threads, configurable via `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` up to 128).
  * **OS kernel** (asynchronous networking & file I/O handled by OS).
  * **Cluster/Worker threads** ‚Üí allow Node.js to use multiple CPU cores.

---

### üîπ Example

* Suppose 1000 users request your API:

  * **In Node.js:**

    * Main event loop receives all requests.
    * Lightweight requests (DB query, network call) ‚Üí delegated to OS/libuv.
    * While OS is busy, Node.js continues handling new requests.
    * So **all 1000 can be served concurrently**, without blocking.
  * **In Java (multi-threaded model):**

    * Each request may spawn a new thread.
    * 1000 requests ‚Üí 1000 threads ‚Üí heavy memory & context switching.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Parallelism Limits

* Node.js JS execution is **not parallel** (only one JS execution at a time).
* But:

  * I/O operations ‚Üí parallel at OS/libuv level.
  * CPU-heavy tasks ‚Üí can use **Worker Threads**.
  * Multi-core scaling ‚Üí `Cluster` module or process managers like **PM2**.

So Node.js can achieve **near-parallel throughput** for I/O workloads, but **true parallel CPU computation** needs explicit workers.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Efficiency Compared to Multithreaded Languages

### ‚úÖ Strengths of Node.js

1. **I/O-bound workloads (APIs, chat apps, file streaming):**

   * Extremely efficient because it **doesn‚Äôt waste threads waiting on I/O**.
   * Event loop can handle **tens of thousands of connections** on modest hardware.
   * Example: LinkedIn switched from Java to Node.js and cut server count from **30 to 3**.

2. **Memory efficiency:**

   * One Node.js process uses far less memory than 1000 Java threads.
   * Java thread \~1 MB stack each. Node.js ‚Üí event loop handles 1000 requests with \~few MB overhead.

---

### ‚ùå Weaknesses of Node.js

1. **CPU-bound tasks (e.g., image processing, ML, encryption):**

   * Node.js chokes because **event loop blocks**.
   * Java/C++/Go (multi-threaded runtimes) perform better here.

2. **Predictable parallelism:**

   * Multi-threaded runtimes can spread computation **automatically** across cores.
   * Node.js needs explicit `cluster` or `worker_threads`.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Numbers

* **RAM**:

  * Hello World Express app ‚Üí \~30 MB.
  * Production API with DB ‚Üí 200‚Äì500 MB per process.
* **Concurrency**:

  * Can handle **10k‚Äì50k concurrent socket connections** per process.
  * Compare: Java servlet threads ‚Üí \~2k‚Äì5k before overhead kills it.
* **Throughput**:

  * Node.js can often serve more requests/sec than traditional Java/Python web servers *for I/O heavy apps*.
* **Latency**:

  * Very low for small async tasks (tens of ms).
  * High if event loop blocked by CPU-intensive code.
